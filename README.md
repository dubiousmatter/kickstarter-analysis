#### Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client, Louise, contracted with us to provide an analysis of relevant Kickstarter campaigns in the theatrical space. Louise began a Kickstarter campaign for her play titled Fever in June of 2016. That campaign sought to raise $2,885. Louise's Kickstarter campaign ended up raising $2,485 in just over thirty days. She then wanted to know how other campaigns in the theatrical space fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Purpose
The purpose of our analysis of relevant Kickstarter campaigns in the theatrical/play category and subcategory was to focus on two primary datasets. The first dataset was Outcomes by Launch Date. Loouise was interested in knowing if there was a correlation between a successful outcome and the time of year that the campaign began. The second dataset was Outcomes Based on Goal. Louise was also interested in knowing if the size of the campaign's goal had any impact on it's success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges
We began our analysis by lookig at over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns in categories including: film & video, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology and theater. This large cross-section of categories was both a blessing and a curse. The large amount of data gave us a sample size large enough to make initial assumptions. However, some of the campaigns not directly related to theater may have been misleading or irrelevant. Thus, we distilled the data down to just those campaigns in the theater/play category and subcategory.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first primary dataset we analyzed was Outcomes Based on Launch Date. We looked at Kickstarter campaigns from the theater/play category and subcategory for all years.
