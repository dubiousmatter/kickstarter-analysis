# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client, Louise, contracted with us to provide an analysis of relevant Kickstarter campaigns in the theatrical space. Louise began a Kickstarter campaign for her play titled Fever in June of 2016. That campaign sought to raise $2,885. Louise's Kickstarter campaign ended up raising $2,485 in just over thirty days. She then wanted to know how other campaigns in the theatrical space fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Purpose
The purpose of our analysis of relevant Kickstarter campaigns in the theatrical/play category and subcategory was to focus on two primary datasets. The first dataset was Outcomes by Launch Date. Louise was interested in knowing if there was a correlation between a successful outcome and the time of year that the campaign began. The second dataset was Outcomes Based on Goal. Louise was also interested in knowing if the size of the campaign's goal had any impact on it's success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges
We began our analysis by lookig at over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns in categories including: film & video, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology and theater. This large cross-section of categories was both a blessing and a curse. The large amount of data gave us a sample size large enough to make initial assumptions. However, some of the campaigns not directly related to theater may have been misleading or irrelevant. Thus, we distilled the data down to just those campaigns in the theater/play category and subcategory.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first primary dataset we analyzed was Outcomes Based on Launch Date. We looked at Kickstarter campaigns from the theater/play category and subcategory for all years.

As you can see from the above chart, there were a total of 1,369 campaigns analyzed. Our analysis did not include live campaigns. Successful campaigns accounted for 61% or 839 of those campaigns. Failed campaigns were lower at 493 or 36% of the total. Campaigns that were ultimately canceled only accounted for 37 or 27% of the total. Our chart also shows that successful campaigns broke out to the upside in late March before peaking and moving steadily lower in May. Failed campaigns, as well as those canceled, remained steady throughout the year.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second primary dataset that we analyzed was Outcomes Based on Goals. Once again, we looked at all Kickstarter campaigns in the theater/play catgory and subcategory. We then broke down the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based upon their goal range.

The above chart shows the percentage of succesful, failed and canceled campaigns on the y-axis and by the goal ranges listed on the x-axis. The percentage of failed campaigns rose steadily until reaching the 25,000 to 25,999 range. Failed outcomes then declined until reaching the 40,000 to 44,999 range, at which point they spiked to their peak in the 45,000 to 49,999 range. Successful campaings moved inversely to failed campaigns by slowly trending lower until reaching the 25,000 to 29,999 range. They then moved higher until reaching the 40,000 to 44,999 range at which point they fell precipitously.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Overall, the Kickstarter analysis went fairly smoothly. However, we did have a slight issue with the Outcomes Based on Goals spreadsheet due to two small mistakes in seperate formulas. When our chart did not look accurate, we went through each of the formulas and found the two errors fairly quickly.

## Results
  * What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date? Successful campaigns usually launched in the spring and peaked in early summer.       Those successful campaigns then declinerd for the remainder of the year.
  
  * What can you conclude about the Outcomes Based on Goals? In general, campaigns become less successful as the dollar amount of their goal increases.
  
  * What are some limitations of the dataset? The potential limitations of the dataset include wide ranges used for the goal amounts examined, no                        accounting for the average size of donations broken down by outcomes, the number of donors by outcome and the country of origin by outcome.
   
  * What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could have charted or graphed the average size of donations broken down by outcomes      and the number of donors by outcome.
